# README

For this application I have created a portfolio to display my work and contact information.
It includes a navigation bar to navigate to different sections of the web page.
The sections for this page include About Me, Work, Contact Me, and an added Resume link on the navigation bar.
This application uses HTML and advanced CSS concepts.
